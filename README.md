# scripts
## Bob Conover
Some Bash shell scripts for copying files, making inheritance lists, making tags, and other useful things I sometimes do on the build servers with the 8xx builds.
### Note:
Make sure you add the following line in your .bash_profile, or wherever your PATH is defined:
####   PATH=$PATH:$HOME/scripts
